> A bot to take the pain out of Contributor License Agreements

This is a version of [excellenteasy's](http://excellenteasy.com) Contributor License Agreement bot, clabot. He's pretty cool.

**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**

Instead this repo provides a library that's distributed by npm that you simply require in your project. Follow the instructions below and get your own hubot ready to deploy.

## Try it out

You can go to our [sandbox](http://github.com/clabot/sandbox) and open Pull Requests. See how clabot automatically responds, guiding you through the process of signing a Contributors License Agreement

## Getting Your Own

We set up a [sample implementation](http://github.com/clabot/sample). Look at the code to set up your own clabot. A verbose tutorial will follow.
